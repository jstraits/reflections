When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    If you want to work on multiple computers, or if multiple people are working on
	a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You might not want every commit to go live before it's ready.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are split off an original repository, and are only available on Github. 
	Clone is making an exact copy of a repository, either to GitHub or somewhere
	else locally. Branches are different off-shoots of commits locally.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can find conflicts before pushing the new commits to GitHub, and
	make changes as soon as possible. It's also useful if you are going
	to be without internet access.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I'd collaborate using email, direct messages, and talking directly. It would
	be easier to ask for instant feedback, bit not necessarily. Plus you would 
	have to compare changes manually.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    You want to use a seperate branch when you don't want to commit changes directly
	to the master, but want to have the work uploaded to GitHub. It's useful when
	collaborating with multiple people on the same project.
